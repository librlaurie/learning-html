## The most basic possible website
1. Download this repository from Github (clone or download button)
1. Open static_site.html in a browser
1. Open the folder in Atom
1. Basic HTML syntax: can you add items to a lists? Link to a different page? Include a different image?
1. Add a comment to tell yourself where you added the new item.


## Stylesheet
1. There's a link to a stylesheet commented out; comment it back in. What changed?
1. Look at stylesheet
1. Basic CSS syntax
1. Can you change the background color on the stylesheet?
1. What happens when you comment the rest of the items in, one at a time?


## A more complicated static site
1. Look at HTML5up-forty folder (included in the zip file), an html5up site template with multiple pages
1. Basic overview of what files are included: index.html, main.css, image folder, etc.
1. Find the place in index.html that creates the menu. What if you want to change what appears on the menu? Try it: only the front page will change, not the others, unless you change those by hand
1. This is the type of problem we'll eventually be able to solve with Jekyll
