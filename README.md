## The most basic possible website
1. Download zip file from Github: html_css_examples.zip
1. Example of simple, one-file HTML/CSS static site; open in browser
1. Basic HTML syntax: can you add items to a lists? Link to a different page? Include a different image?
1. Command-slash will comment highlighted text out in Atom; practice that

## Stylesheet
1. There's a link to a stylesheet commented out; comment it back in. What changed?
1. Look at stylesheet
1. Basic CSS syntax
1. Can you change the background color on the stylesheet?
1. What happens when you comment the rest of the items in, one at a time?
1. Why are we seeing two different fonts on the page? What can you do about that?
1. Add and define a class, then use that class somewhere in the html
1. Try linking to Bootstrap in the stylesheet
1. Add an element from Bootstrap

## A more complicated static site
1. Look at Forty (included in the zip file), an html5up site template with multiple pages
1. Project this; people can download if they want
1. Basic overview of what files are included: index.html, main.css, image folder, etc.
1. Find the place in index.html that creates the menu. What if you want to change what appears on the menu? Try it: only the front page will change, not the others, unless you change those by hand
1. This is the type of problem we'll eventually be able to solve with Jekyll
